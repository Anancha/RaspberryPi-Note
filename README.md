## Docs

1. [setup guide](https://github.com/koji/RaspberyPi-Note/blob/master/doc/setup/README.md) This focuses on inital setup.
2. [create a swapfile](https://github.com/koji/RaspberyPi-Note/blob/master/doc/setup/swapfile.md)
Basically, this is for installing a heavy program like OpenCV.  
3. [set crontab](https://github.com/koji/RaspberyPi-Note/blob/master/doc/setup/crontab_settings.md) The sample is how to take a photo with webcam every 8 am.
4. [install vnc_viewer](https://github.com/koji/RaspberyPi-Note/blob/master/doc/setup/vnc_viewer.md) This is useful when we don't have a monitor for pi and want to use GUI.
